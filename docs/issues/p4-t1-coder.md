# CODER Task: Draft Discripper Workflow Case Study (#P4-T1)

> Linked checklist entry: [TASKS.md (#P4-T1)](../../TASKS.md#phase-4--advanced-workflow-case-study-lessons-from-discripper)  
> Labels: `phase:training`, `type:docs`, `topic:workflow`

## Problem
- The outline for the Discripper workflow case study (tracking #P4-T1) is merged, but we still need CODER to draft the production-ready lesson copy in `docs/09-discripper-workflow-case-study.md`.

## Acceptance criteria
- Expand the chapter into a polished narrative that walks through PRD → TASKS → Codex → Draft PR using anonymized artifacts drawn from the discripper project.
- Include a before/after Codex prompt excerpt paired with the corresponding Draft PR diff to highlight the hand-off described in the checklist.
- Ensure the README “Chapters” list links to the lesson with learner-focused language and aligns with other Phase 4 docs.
- Cross-link to supporting chapters so readers can follow the broader workflow sequence without leaving the lesson.
- Apply the labels `phase:training`, `type:docs`, and `topic:workflow` to the GitHub issue when filing it.

## Constraints
- Use HTTPS remotes and GitHub CLI where possible.
- Maintain the anonymization approach already established in Phase 4 docs.
- Keep formatting consistent with existing Markdown conventions (e.g., sentence-case headings, fenced code blocks for excerpts).

## Test plan
- No automated tests; request editorial review and click-test the README + chapter links.

## Rollback
- Revert the documentation changes and restore the previous README entry if the new content does not meet expectations.
