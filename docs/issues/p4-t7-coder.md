# CODER Task: Reinforce Documentation Discipline (#P4-T7)

> Linked checklist entry: [TASKS.md (#P4-T7)](../../TASKS.md#phase-4--advanced-workflow-case-study-lessons-from-discripper)  
> Labels: `phase:training`, `type:docs`, `topic:workflow`

## Problem
- The documentation discipline outline (#P4-T7) now needs CODER to deliver the final learner guidance in `docs/12-documentation-discipline.md`, emphasizing end-of-task checklists and changelog alignment.

## Acceptance criteria
- Add guidance on closing each task with doc updates, release notes, and changelog entries, including a reusable checklist learners can adopt.
- Provide a PR summary snippet that ties code changes back to docs and changelog updates, mirroring the outline.
- Clarify when README/Table-of-Contents updates are expected whenever new chapters appear.
- Reinforce that the corresponding GitHub issue should carry labels `phase:training`, `type:docs`, `topic:workflow` so the work stays discoverable.
- Apply the labels `phase:training`, `type:docs`, and `topic:workflow` to the GitHub issue when filing it.

## Constraints
- Use HTTPS remotes and GitHub CLI where possible.
- Keep tone instructional and aligned with the other Phaseâ€¯4 lessons.
- Follow Markdown style conventions for checklists and examples.

## Test plan
- No automated checks; request editorial review and verify internal references render correctly.

## Rollback
- Revert the documentation discipline lesson if it no longer matches the intended closeout practice.
